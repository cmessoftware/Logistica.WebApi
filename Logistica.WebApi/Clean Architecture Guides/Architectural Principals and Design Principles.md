## Architecture Principles
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Loose coupling


## Guiding Design Principles
- **Separation of concerns**
- **Encapsulation** - focuses on hiding implementation details from other components in your system. 
- **Dependency Inversion** - depending on abstractions at compile time and implementations at runtime.
- **Explicit dependencies** - your components should be honest about their dependencies and what they need to function.
- **Single responsibility** - your components should have one responsivity only and only one reason to change.
- **DRY**
- **Persistence ignorance** - concerned with how you design your entities. You should design your entities in such a way that it doesn't matter what tools you use to persist your data information.
- Bounded context - a conceptual model grouping related entities and behaviors together.
